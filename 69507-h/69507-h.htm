  <h2 class='c007'>WHAT IS COLOR?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Color is an effect caused by the reflection of certain
rays of light. In order to understand this
statement, it is necessary that we know what
light is. Science teaches us that light is a form
of intense vibration which reaches the earth direct
from the sun. These vibrations affect certain
nerves of the retina of the eye, causing the sensation
known as color.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the study of color, or in practice, it is necessary
that we have a standard. The standard colors
are those seen in the spectrum or in the rainbow.
These colors are selected as standard colors
because they are the true colors as reflected by
pure light and they never change.</p>

<p class='c002'>In dealing with pigments the primary colors are
yellow, red and blue. They are called primary
colors because all other colors are produced from
them, and because they can not be produced by
mixing other colors. In other words, they are
the original colors from which all other colors are
produced.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>WARM AND COLD COLORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cold and warm colors: Red warm, blue cold,
yellow bright. White, which is also a cold color
when added to black makes a cold gray. Yellow
added to red forms a warm orange.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MEANING OF COLORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>White is said to mean purity; blue, fidelity or
truth; red, love or sacrifice; green, envy; pink,
modesty; violet, innocence; yellow, jealousy;
black, sorrow or distress, and lavender, passion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>ART OF COLOR MIXING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mixing colors is an art in itself. With a combination
of the chief colors—red, yellow, blue
(and black and white), thousands of shades and
hues may be produced.</p>

<p class='c002'>Mixed in various proportions, either in twos, or
all three together, these three colors produce
every hue in nature or in art, every tint that is
physically possible.</p>

<p class='c002'>The primary colors are yellow, red and blue.</p>

<p class='c002'>The secondary colors are orange, violet and
green.</p>

<p class='c002'>The tertiary colors are citron, russet and olive.</p>

<p class='c002'>The secondary colors are made as follows: Yellow
and red make orange, red and blue make violet,
yellow and blue make green.</p>

<p class='c002'>The tertiary colors are mixed from the secondary
colors as follows: Orange and violet make
russet, violet and green make olive, orange and
green make citron.</p>

<p class='c002'>Black, white and gray are natural tones in
which no color is apparent: White pales but does
not brighten any color. Yellow is the brightening
color and always stands out strong and advancing;
to deepen a color, use its complementary
color; to deepen yellow add purple; to deepen red
add blue; to deepen blue add burnt sienna, then
you will have purity of color.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>THE TWO EXTREMES OF WARM AND COLD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Vermilion or any other red of orange hue
(warm). Bluish blue (cold). These two colors
mixed together in certain proportions form light
brown, dark brown, red-brown, neutral brown and
scarlet red. Purple made from this combination
is inferior.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>COLOR BLINDNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Today, color-blindness is a serious difficulty in
the way of a person earning a living. A generation
or so ago, it was considered a matter of small
importance. Many persons, suffering from the
disease, went through life without knowing they
were afflicted. The only persons, as a class, who
were greatly affected by the problem were railroad
men, who had to take tests for the distinction
of colors.</p>

<p class='c002'>Today, with the common use of automobiles
and the rapidly growing use of colored lights for
signs and signals, color-blindness becomes an important
matter.</p>

<p class='c002'>The defect is hereditary and much more common
in men than in women. A woman may have
normal eyesight herself and yet transmit the
color-blindness to her children. This is because
it is what the geneticist calls a recessive character.
A man may have a color-blind father and
still not transmit the defect. But a color-blind
woman, married to a color-blinded man, transmits
the defect to all off-springs, both sons and
daughters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>ALTERING COLOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To brighten color, add yellow; to give it
warmth, add red. To brighten and warm, add orange.
To deepen and cool, add blue. To cool and
lighten, add green; to deepen and warm, add
purple.</p>

<p class='c002'>Ultramarine blue contains sulphur and will
tarnish with admixtures of pigment containing
lead. Substitute zinc white.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>PIGMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Pigment is any color preparation used by painters,
printing pressmen, etc. Coloring matter is
found in pigment cells of plants, tissues of animals
and fish; in mineral form found in the earth,
from coal, vegetables, etc.</p>

<p class='c002'>Pigments may be divided into two classes, the
organic and the inorganic. Organic pigments are
compounds of carbon and the inorganic all other
pigments.</p>

<p class='c002'>Paints and printers’ inks are made from the
same pigments; the difference is in the mordant.
It all depends on the nature of the object to be
colored. The mordant is the fixer which holds
the pigment.</p>

<p class='c002'>The selection of color material should be carefully
made. Purchase from reliable dealers an
assortment of reds, blues and yellows, some black
and white.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>NATURE’S COLOR CHART OF HARMONIOUS COMBINATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nature has given us a wonderful color chart,
of harmonious colors mingled together.</p>

<p class='c002'>Flowers furnish countless color combinations
which are perfect in every detail. Colors ranging
from soft, delicate tints to deep, rich solids,
are found in great variety.</p>

<p class='c002'>Observe also the birds, whose plumage range
from the most gorgeous to the so-called jet black
raven or black birds; even they when viewed in
sun or strong light reveal a picture of dazzling
beauty. Beautiful tones and semi-tones of purple,
green and blue blending perfectly with the
black.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is unnecessary to mention in detail, the
fields, woods and forest, the seas, the lofty, stately
mountain peaks of somber hues silhouetted
against an azure sky or viewed in the setting sun.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>COLOR HARMONY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The secret of harmony is equal value, complementary
colors are the color or colors which,
with any color or colors mentioned, make the
three primary colors, which constitute white
light. For example if given color is a primary,
its complementary color is composed of the other
two primary colors; the complementary color of
blue is orange, red and yellow. And if given
color be a secondary, its complementary color is
the remaining color. Thus the complementary
color of green, blue and yellow is red.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is well to bear in mind whether the subject
to be treated is a landscape scene, color design,
form to be printed in colors, sign or house
painting that equal value of colors is the correct
way.</p>

<p class='c002'>Any subject that has been ill-treated with too
much red, or colors which do not harmonize, form
a combination that irritates.</p>

<p class='c002'>When colors are correctly used the effect is
soothing. Remember that red is the most irritating
color and a little will balance well with a
large amount of other colors.</p>

<p class='c002'>The object to be painted or printed has a lot
to do with the selection of colors. It is well
to study the subject carefully.</p>

<p class='c002'>Printing pressmen have their problems. When
printing on white material which is a neutral
color he does not encounter the obstacles as when
printing colored inks on colored material.</p>

<p class='c002'>All fine pictorial color printing is executed on
white material, this being the only way to get
pure coloring, as it is generally printed with
transparent ink.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tint mixing is both interesting and profitable,
but in order to obtain the best results, first-class
materials are very essential. Great care should
be exercised in the selection of this material, as
the product of one manufacturer often varies, as
to shade with that of another manufacture, therefore
it is well for the color mixer to make it a
rule, never to select colors promiscuously.</p>

<p class='c002'>With the following colors at hand all known
colors may be obtained. Lemon yellow, which is
of greenish hue; yellow of orange hue; red with
orange hue; red which has a bluish cast. Blue
with a reddish tone, also blue with a leaning toward
green. A liberal supply of white and some
black which does not contain blue.</p>

<p class='c002'>To produce a pure tint you must first produce
a pure base of the primary colors. White, which
is a neutral color, does not alter the original hue,
it merely pales. In making pure greens from
yellow and blue, the yellow and blue should contain
none of the primary color red; use a greenish
yellow and greenish blue. For pure orange
use a yellow and red which contain none of the
primary blue; the yellow must be of reddish hue,
the red of yellowish cast. Pure violets are made
with bluish reds and reddish blues. The red and
blue should not contain any of the primary color
yellow.</p>

<p class='c002'>Gray tint is white with black in various proportions.
Neutral gray must be mixed from a
black which is unadulterated with a mixture of
blue. To warm, add a touch of red; to cool, add a
small amount of blue. The object in making
neutral gray as above mentioned is to make possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>a true blending with other colors. For example,
a bluish gray is desired, add blue to neutral
gray until the exact shade is acquired; for
orange gray add a touch of orange, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c002'>Primary colors are made neutral by admixture,
a medium or neutral yellow is obtained by mixing
lemon yellow with orange yellow. The greenish
tinge of lemon yellow is absorbed by the reddish
tinge of orange yellow. Neutral red and blue is
made in the same manner; likewise the blues.</p>

<p class='c002'>As has been previously mentioned, white when
added for tinting purposes does not alter the
hues. For example, the result of adding white
in any quantity to purplish red is a purplish pink
tint, the purple hue will remain.</p>

<p class='c002'>When warm tints are desired use a warm base.
For warm pink select a red of orange hue, a cool
pink from bluish red, a neutral pink must be
made from a neutral base which is the result of
adding primary bluish red and primary yellowish
red.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>TO MATCH SPECIAL COLORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In mixing special colors or shades for large
jobs, first mix a small quantity, write down exact
proportions either by weight or volume, keep
a record for future reference.</p>

<p class='c002'>If you have failed to keep a record and have a
small quantity on hand and wish to duplicate it
exactly, put a small amount on a piece of white
paper and after mixing a little dribble or let it
string across the original sample you can get a
perfect match. Still another way; brush a small
quantity on a piece of transparent glass, add a
like amount of the paint you mix beside it and
hold to the light.</p>

<p class='c002'>To match a specimen in printing ink; mix the
color (small quantity), ink up press, pull an impression
then with your make ready knife cut
a small hole (any shape) in the most solid part
of print, lay this over a solid part of sample.</p>

    <div>COLORS AS SEEN BY INDIVIDUALS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The same color scheme does not appeal to every
one. Persons of refined temperament are best
pleased with soft, delicate colors and shades.</p>

<p class='c002'>People who are less refined admire deeper tones;
yet want absolute harmony, while coarse individuals
are satisfied with bright gaudy colors. Color
is a sensation produced on the retina of the eye,
by the action of one or more of the elements of
light. Exact proportion by parts are not given
in the following in order to let you be the judge
of the exact shade. Follow the simple rule of
using a little more of the dark colors of each
color combination if a deeper shade is wanted and
vice versa for a lighter one.</p>

<p class='c002'>You will note in the entire list of color mixtures
different combinations to get practically the
same color, scarcely no two persons view the same
shade alike.</p>

<p class='c002'>In listing different mixtures for the same color
you have a better chance of using up some of the
many colors that would otherwise accumulate, also
giving you your choice of the color that is best
adapted to your needs. More than 10,000 colors,
hues and tints can be obtained from this Guide.
Example or rule for obtaining special shades such
as are not listed. Look through the list, carefully
select the combination that comes nearest to your
requirements. If the listed color is too light add
more of the darker colors or if too dark add the
lighter colors.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>In mixing colors, always commence with the
lighter and add the darker, otherwise you will
mix a greater quantity than desired. In this list
of color combinations the first named color always
predominates; the others are named in the
order of amount needed. Follow this rule unless
otherwise instructed.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>HINTS FOR PAINTERS AND DECORATORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A house painted white not only looks cool, but is
cool, as white reflects the sun’s rays. The effect
at night is reversed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The amount of trimming color necessary is
usually about one-fifth of that required for the
entire surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not paint damp or unseasoned, sappy or
pitchy wood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not paint or paper walls having a northern
exposure with cold color such as blue, gray or
white. Use warm tones like rose, tan, etc. And
in like manner better results are obtained by
using the cold shades or colors in rooms with a
southern exposure.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COVERING CAPACITY OF VARNISH</h3>

<p class='c010'>One gallon of varnish will cover approximately
300 square feet, two coats when properly
flowed on.</p>

<p class='c002'>Varnish is transparent and therefore cannot
hide any defects in a surface. If the surface is
badly marred, use graining materials. Or cover
up the old surface with a suitable paint or
enamel.</p>

<p class='c008'>NEW WOOD.—Before varnishing new open
grained wood such as oak, ash and mahogany, it
is necessary to fill the pores with a good filler.
Some prefer it in paste form. This is not absolutely
necessary for close-grained woods such as
maple, pine and birch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Paint for general purpose is composed of lead,
zinc, linseed oil and turpentine dryer, which are
the best known ingredients, excepting such colors
that cannot be made from lead and zinc.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lead, when used alone does not make as serviceable
a paint as lead and zinc ground together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in pure linseed oil and colors. Zinc is recognized
as an indispensable ingredient in paint.
Lead, while quite necessary, is likely to change
when used alone, by that is meant, it discolors
easily, and when exposed to the air chalks off and
leaves the wood exposed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Zinc, which is a more durable metal, retains
its whiteness also gives to colors and permits
incorporating the largest possible quantity of
linseed oil, thus giving life and durability to
the paint. A mixture of both lead and zinc, is,
therefore, necessary to obtain best results to resist
light, heat and cold.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NEW WORK</h3>

<p class='c010'>To secure best results, new work should have
three coats, that is two besides the priming coat.</p>

<p class='c002'>Do not prime or apply paint to a new building
until plastering is thoroughly dried out.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ADULTERATING COLORS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Do not imagine that the durability of paint is
increased by the use of whiting, clay, silica and
other cheap materials. They only make bulk and
trouble.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>AGGREGATED FORM OF CHECKING</h3>

<p class='c010'>Avoid “alligatoring,” which is a form of checking
and frequently caused by applying finished
coats over priming or second coats before drying.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SEEDY, SPECKY, SANDY VARNISH</h3>

<p class='c010'>You may find varnish to be full of small grains.
This may be due to chill in transit or in storage,
or a decided difference in temperature between
the varnish and the work. Allow the varnish to
reach the temperature of the work before applying.
The same appearance may be caused by
what painters term a “lousy” brush. USE ONLY
AN ABSOLUTELY CLEAN BRUSH.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>PAINT FOR STIPPLING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For rough stipple, mix your paint from equal
parts of white lead in oil, zinc white in oil and
dry plaster of paris (the latter of the finest
grade). Thin down with raw linseed oil and turpentine
in equal parts, adding two teaspoonfuls
of pale japan to each pint of liquid. Make the
paint just stout enough to apply with a wall
brush and put it on in that consistency. When
the surface has been so coated, and before the
paint begins to set, use a good size stippler, and
see that you do the work uniformly and evenly.
You can color the white to any desired tint with
finely powdered dry color or you may use color
ground in oil, but if much of the latter is required,
use one-third raw oil and two-thirds turpentine
for thinning. When solid color is desired
for wall stippling, use colors ground in oil
and the finest bolted whiting, dry to make stout
paste. Mix in this paste with one part oil and
three parts turpentine and add one part japan.
When the paint is applied in stout consistency, it
may be stippled or combed and very pretty effects
are obtained. Before applying the stipple to unpainted
walls, two coats of pure lead in oil should
be given.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GOOD BRUSHES GET GOOD RESULTS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Keep brushes out of water. When paint and
varnish brushes are not in use, they should be
suspended in raw linseed oil away from the bottom
of the container by at least two inches and
at least an inch above the bottom ferrule or
strap. Water is not a paint solvent. When
brushes are suspended in linseed oil, the oil will
dissolve the pigment which, being heavier, will
sink to the bottom of the container, in this way
cleaning the brush.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>Quantity Needed.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To ascertain the number of gallons of paint
required for a building:—add the width of front
and rear with the length of both sides, and multiply
by the height. A gallon of paint, properly
brushed out, will cover 350 square feet, two
coats. Do not flow the paint on, but thoroughly
brush it on.</p>

<p class='c002'>By dividing the total feet of surface by 350,
you will obtain the number of gallons necessary
to paint the house, two coats. The above estimate,
owing to the fact that surfaces vary in
their natures, is based on a surface of good condition
to receive the paint.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TO REMOVE RUST STAINS FROM CONCRETE OR STUCCO</h3>

<p class='c010'>Rust stains can be removed from concrete or
stucco work by scrubbing the spots with a solution
of 1 part muriatic acid and 5 parts water.
When using this, the hands should be well protected
from the acid as it is very strong, and
will cause severe burns. After scrubbing the
concrete, the acid must be well rinsed off with
clean water.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>ALUMINUM PAINT MAKES RADIATORS LESS EFFICIENT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The aluminum or bronze paint generally applied
to radiators greatly reduces their effectiveness
and makes it necessary to have a larger
surface for the same heating effect, according to
experiments performed by Dr. W. W. Coblentz,
of the Bureau of Standards. Dr. Coblentz finds
that the heat radiated from an aluminum painted
radiator surface is less than a third of that emitted
by a radiator of the same size painted with a
non-metallic paint, enameled, or simply allowed
to rust.</p>

<p class='c002'>On the other hand, he finds that aluminum
paint is a very effective means of reducing the
amount of heat transmitted through a thin material.
Applied to the under side of a tent or
awning, it reduces by three-fourths the amount of
heat from the sun which gets through the cloth,
while if used on the cover of an automobile or
ice wagon it cuts in half the heat let through and
makes the temperature inside the vehicle more
nearly that found in natural shade, thereby making
it much more comfortable.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PAINT AND VARNISH REMOVER</h3>

<p class='c010'>Benzol and denatured alcohol, equal parts applied
to a painted or varnished surface, will eat
through to the bare wood in less than ten minutes’
time.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW ENAMEL IS APPLIED TO METAL</h3>

<p class='c010'>The basis of all enamels is an easily fusible,
colorless glass, to which the desired color and
opacity are imparted by mixtures of metallic oxides.
The mass, after being fused together and
cooled, is reduced to a fine powder, washed and
applied to the surfaces to be covered. The whole
is then exposed in a furnace till the enamel is

  <h3 class='c009'>TO RETARD THE DRYING OF PLASTER OF PARIS FOR FIVE HOURS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Plaster of Paris can be retarded by dissolving
carpenter’s glue or common paste in the mixing
water. To retard it so that it will not set within
five hours will require about 2 per cent. of glue,
the percentage being based on the weight of the
plaster.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CEMENT PANEL PAINT FOR BLACKBOARDS</h3>

<p class='c010'>If you prefer to mix your own paint for cement
panel blackboards, use drop black in turpentine,
add an equal weight of finest powdered
pumicestone mixed in turps and hard oak finish,
and thin with enough varnish and turpentine to
bind it hard.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PAINTING STUCCO</h3>

<p class='c010'>In painting stucco, the following instructions
should be observed. After brushing thoroughly,
prepare for the priming coat by mixing one part,
by weight, of white lead, red lead, and boiled oil.
White lead, stainers, driers, to the extent of one-fourteenth
of the mixture, two parts boiled oil,
and one part turpentine, form the basis for the
second and third coatings. Additional coating
should contain less turpentine in proportion to
the oil.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A REMEDY FOR LOW CEILINGS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Rooms with low ceilings can be made to appear
much higher by using a striped paper, preferably

  <h2 class='c007'>HINTS FOR PRESSMEN</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>COVER WHITE</h3>

<p class='c010'>When cover white is too short or stiff to be
workable, add a small amount of mixing white.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PROCESS COLOR PRINTING</h3>

<p class='c010'>For the very best results in this fascinating
art, print the lighter colors first, as follows: Yellow,
red, blue and black unless otherwise instructed
by the engraver.</p>

<p class='c002'>When dark colors are run first contrary to progressive
proof, the full richness and detail are
lost and hues altered. Light colors printed over
the dark detail, modify and subdue the sharpness
which is not always desirable.</p>

<p class='c002'>Use opaque yellow for the first color when
printing on tinted stock; follow with transparent
colors.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GOLD SIZE FOR BRONZE POWDER</h3>

<p class='c010'>All pigment that enters into the manufacture
of gold size must be earthen. Yellow ocher is
admirably adapted for this purpose, as in hue it
ranges from a pale yellow to light brown. It is
insoluble in oil and will not dull the luster of
bronze powder or bleed through.</p>

<p class='c002'>Gold size for pale gold bronze should be pale
yellow; for deep rich gold bronze use medium
light orange brown size.</p>

<p class='c002'>Deep rich gold when applied over pale yellow
size produces a medium gold cast.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>STREAKING AND SHADOWS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Streaking or shadows which occur when running
heavy solids, can oftimes be overcome on
three roller platen presses by using a steel vibrator,
also expansion trucks which trip third
roller. If expansion trucks are not available use
vibrator and remove third roller, as in most cases
this roller is causing the trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coach varnish adds lustre to printers’ ink.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>MOTTLING AND PICKING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mottling of printers’ ink is largely due to an
over-abundance of reducer, which separates the
pigment from the mordant. This difficulty is
sometimes overcome by adding silicate of soda
(water glass), magnesia, etc. These absorb some
of the superfluous oil and force the pigment into
a solid mass.</p>

<p class='c002'>Reducing to eliminate picking is the principal
cause of mottle. Before mixing reducer with ink,
add a little soft ink, such as halftone; if straight
halftone picks, add 00 varnish.</p>

<p class='c002'>Inks are made for all purposes. Best results
are obtained by using them without adulteration.
Oftentimes a drop or two of linseed oil distributed
on press will do the trick. If ink mottles from
the start with no other inks at hand, use less ink
and double roll.</p>

<p class='c002'>Picking and mottling on platen presses is more
prevalent than on cylinders. The reasons are obvious.
The cylinder requires less ink, has ample
distribution and the printed sheet is peeled from
the form.</p>

<p class='c002'>Every printing press has its capacity. You can
not successfully print a solid oversize form just
because it can be locked in a platen chase. Even
with a good vibrator, this kind of form requires
double or triple rolling. Taking into consideration
the fact that friskets jerk printed sheet from
the form, you need not look farther for the cause
of picking.</p>

<p class='c002'>By cutting stock two or more up, and inking
form the narrow way with enough of the sheet
to be printed protruding for a good hand hold,
you can peel it from the form. Do not allow
friskets to touch the sheet.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WASH FOR DIRTY TYPE OR CUTS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Crude carbolic acid and turpentine, equal parts.
Let stand over night. Rinse off with gasoline.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Color Printing—Some very pretty effects are obtained

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>In addition to the above formula purchase ten
cents’ worth of analine (any color desired) from
your druggist, dissolve this in two ounces of
glycerine. Then stir all together. The glycerine
keeps the glue flexible and prevents cracking. This
formula, in print for the first time, means the
saving of a great many dollars.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MIXING GLASS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Before mixing colors on glass, glue or lay a
sheet of white paper to the back. Or paint it
white.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WHEN TO USE OPAQUE PROCESS INK</h3>

<p class='c010'>When printing process colors on tinted stock,
use an opaque yellow, follow with transparent
colors.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PROTECTIVE VARNISH FOR PRINTERS’ PLATES</h3>

<p class='c010'>Printing plates, especially etchings which are
chiefly composed of zinc, may be kept free from
corrosion by dipping or painting with a liquid
solution of gum arabic, which is soluble in water.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>BLACK AND WHITE AS COLORS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Figuratively speaking black and white are
colors but technically they are not. Pigments
that are jet black and pure white either vegetable
or mineral are unknown. It takes the addition
of blue to alter the yellowish cast of
white, and blue to deepen the brownish cast of
any so called black pigment.</p>

<p class='c008'>White being a neutral color, will harmonize
with most any color combination.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NEUTRAL HUES AND TINTS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Neutral hues are made by a 50–50 mixture of
warm and cold colors. White added to neutral
hues produce neutral tints.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whiting—Chalk pulverized and freed from impurities.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>VARNISH FOR THE BACK OF SILVERED MIRRORS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Dammar gum, 20 parts; asphalt, 3 parts;
gutta-percha, 5 parts; benzol, 75 parts; mix and
dissolve. To use this varnish, pour it over the
silvered surface and move the plate back and
forth until it is distributed evenly over the surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soft toned (flat finish) colors and tints are very
desirable in the modern home. The flat or dull
finish prevents the reflection of light, and makes
a desirable back ground for pictures and
draperies.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COLOR IN SOAP BUBBLES</h3>

<p class='c010'>The beautiful colors of an ordinary soap bubble
are caused by light shining through the thin filament
and being reflected from its inner surface.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>INVISIBLE WRITING INK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of white sugar in
half cup full of boiling water. Write in the ordinary
manner. Holding to the fire will cause the
saccharine to turn brown.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>INK FOR RUBBER STAMP PADS</h3>

<p class='c010'>Dissolve ten cents’ worth of red analine (or any
other color) in two ounces of glycerine and apply
to stamp pad with stiff brush; smooth it on as
evenly as possible.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FRESHEN RUBBER STAMP PADS</h3>

<p class='c010'>To freshen up old rubber stamp pads, scrape surface
of pad with a dull knife or edge of stiff cardboard
to remove dust. Then apply clear glycerine.
Pad is now almost as good as new.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BLACK TRACING PAPER</h3>

<p class='c010'>Lamp black mixed with cold lard to the consistency
of thick paste. Apply to thin paper with a
piece of cloth. Then take a flannel cloth and rub
until the color ceases to come off. If red is desired
use Venetian red. For blue use Prussian blue,
and for green use chrome green.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COMMON BLACK WRITING INK</h3>

<p class='c010'>One ounce extract of logwood; pour over it two
quarts of boiling soft water. When dissolved add
one drachm of yellow chromate of potassa. Put in
clean bottles. This formula will cost about 15
cents.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EVERLASTING BLACK WRITING INK</h3>

<p class='c010'>Two gallons of rain water, ¼ pound gum arabic,
½ pound copperas, ¾ pound powdered nut-galls, ¼
pound of brown sugar. Bruise all and mix. This
is valuable for copying deeds, etc., as it will last for
hundreds of years. Shake the mixture occasionally

<h3 class='c009'>TO REMOVE OIL STAINS FROM LEATHER</h3>

<p class='c010'>Dab the spot carefully with spirits of sal ammoniac,
and after allowing it to act for awhile,
wash with clean water. This treatment may have
to be repeated a few times, taking care, however,
not to injure the color of the leather.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BLEACHING TALLOW</h3>

<p class='c010'>Dissolve alum, five pounds, in water, ten gallons,

Fig. 2) being careful to wet entire surface.</p>

<p class='c002'>To avoid air pockets (wide open colorless
spaces) bend card or paper slightly as shown in
figure 2. Mottled marble effects are obtained
when waves are nearly settled or quite still.</p>

<p class='c002'>The coloring adheres to the sheet instantly
and it is needless to hold it under water. Colors
will run if used in excessive quantity or failure to
thin enough. If air pockets form, wait until
thoroughly dry before redipping in solution.</p>

<p class='c002'>White oil paint or printer’s ink may be mixed
with colors to form tints before same is thinned.
More thinning of colors also make lighter
shades.</p>

<p class='c002'>Over painting on these backgrounds should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>executed with color ground in Japan to better
adhere to the slightly greasy surface.</p>

<p class='c002'>Show card writers may obtain rather unique
effects with the following:</p>

<p class='c002'>On a blank card paint or draw all or part of
the lettering and border with show card writer’s
white which is soluble in water.</p>

<p class='c002'>When thoroughly dry dip into marbling solution
as has been previously described, when dry,
place in running water until all show card writer’s
white is washed free. A clean soft brush
will help loosen it.</p>

<p class='c002'>The marbling colors should be a trifle darker
with less agitation. The darker background will
help show to better advantage the pure white
border and lettering.</p>

<p class='c002'>White material is best for marbling. White, a
neutral color will not alter the various colors
and tints applied in this process. However, colored
board may be used to good advantage for
certain purposes.</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>DRAWINGS RESEMBLE PRINTING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To Make Drawings Resemble Printing—Black
and White or a Variety of Colors</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_068.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c002'>First—Make light pencil sketch of subject on
any good paper or cardboard such as is used
when water-colors are employed. Outline all high
lights and other portions which are to remain white.</p>

<p class='c002'>Second—With brush or pen fill in all high
lights and other portions which are to remain
white with show card writer’s white, which is
soluble in water, and let dry.</p>

<p class='c002'>Third—Partly fill any shallow tray or dish
with (water proof) ink, black or colored, if desired.
Now dip drawing and let dry.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Fourth—When black or colored water proof
inks are thoroughly dry place into running water
until the white is washed free from drawing,
exposing the clean surface of material. Place
between blotters which have been weighted and
let dry.</p>

<p class='c002'>With this process your drawings can show no
brush marks. The solids will remain smooth
and dense as though printed. If plates for
printing purposes are to be made from drawings,
you will obtain splendid clean cut results by
using this dipping process.</p>

<p class='c002'>Show card writer’s white and (water proof)
black or colors may be obtained at any art shop.</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>SPATTER</h3>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Most everyone is familiar with spatter work.
Shading and background effects for drawings,
show cards, art candles, etc., may be treated
with spatter in one or more colors.</p>

<p class='c002'>Color in the form of fine dots is thrown upon
the unprotected portions of material by rubbing
the inked bristles of a brush on a sieve or with
a knife blade.</p>

<p class='c002'>Necessary materials: India or common writing
ink, a tooth brush, pocket knife, rubber
cement, cardboard and some thin transparent
tracing paper. The latest and most effective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>method is to spatter through a sieve, with a
round medium stiff brush as shown in the accompanying
illustration.</p>

<p class='c002'>With point of knife cut out letters which are
traced from painted show card and paste with
rubber cement, or weight with small objects to
prevent color from running under the edges,
directly on the face of each corresponding letter
and apply spatter. Remove these masks when
the work has dried.</p>

<p class='c002'>High lights may be added to spatter drawings
with touches of Chinese or show card writers
white with a pencil brush.</p>

<p class='c002'>Gold ink spatter shows well on dark materials;
white is effective on black material. Pleasing
backgrounds are produced by thinly covering
material with rice, flax seed, leaves, sawdust, etc.
Apply spatter and let thoroughly dry before disturbing
to prevent smearing.</p>

the most legible contrasts of color for show
cards, posters, billboards and large outdoor advertising
display signs—60 of them.</p>

<p>The Color Chart</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This book answers many vexing questions that
come up unexpectedly every day—the little technical
puzzlers that harass and hinder you most. It contains
a wealth of information written in understandable
form for the novice as well as the experienced
user of colors.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Color Chart alone is well worth the price of
this entire book. It consists of three sections which
tell how to select warm and cool colors, mix colors
to get any tint or shade, harmonize colors and avoid
color discord. Twenty-five individual colors appear
in the chart, all applied by hand with lacquer to a
cloth backed sheet that cannot be easily damaged.
Mounted on it are the pivoted triangle and the arrow,
both white celluloid, by the use of which color mixing,
matching and harmonizing are simplified.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
